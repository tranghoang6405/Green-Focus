                <p>This is a general-interest course that examines the current state of computer 
                    crime and forensic analysis. We  explore the spectrum of cybercrimes in detail, 
                    considering how real-world crimes have incorporated technology, and the resultant 
                    unique forms of offending that have emerged as a direct result. We consider the 
                    emergent unique subcultures in online environments around a form of deviance, crime, 
                    or a specific ideology. We also study how law enforcement agencies investigate and 
                    enforce the laws that have been created to address these issues.</p>

                <h3>COIS 3560H</h3>
                <p>This course is designed to provide
                    students with a comprehensive understanding of HCI, focusing on the design, evaluation, and
                    implementation of interactive computing systems, aiming to optimize user experiences and
                    enhance overall usability. Students will delve into the theoretical foundations of HCI, exploring
                    cognitive psychology, user-centred design, and social theories related to understanding users.
                    The course will also cover the practical aspects of HCI, including usability testing, user interface
                    (UI) design, and the integration of user feedback into the development process.</p>
